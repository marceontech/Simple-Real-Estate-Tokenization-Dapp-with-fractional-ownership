# Simple-Real-Estate-Tokenization-Dapp-with-fractional-ownership
A Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization smart contract, allowing fractional ownership of real estate properties through blockchain-based ERC-721 or ERC-3643 standards, deployable on any EVM network

# Context:

Real estate investments typically require large capital and involve intermediaries. Tokenizing properties allows fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and global investor participation. Starting with this smart contract you may build:

* Real Estate Investment Platforms: Enables tokenized ownership of rental and commercial properties.
* DeFi & RWAs: Integrates real estate assets into DeFi lending and collateralized loans.
* Grant Global Access: Reduces entry barriers for property investment worldwide.


# Smart Contract explanation:

* Property Owner Mints Tokens: Each token represents fractional ownership of a real estate asset.
  
* Investors Purchase Tokens: Investors buy tokens to gain ownership and rental income rights.
  
* Smart Contract Manages Transfers: Tokens follow compliance rules for ownership and resale.
  
* Dividends & Governance: Token holders may receive rent income and participate in property decisions.

* Create a "Transfer Ownership" Button: Calls ```transferProperty(to, propertyId)```.
